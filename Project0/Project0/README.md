# Project0
My Project0 Banking Application


In this Banking Application, I have implemented the different softwares and technologies I have learned from my first two weeks at Revature. 
This Project0 is focused only on the back-end of the application, where my next project(Project1) wil focus both, the front-end and back-end of the Banking application. 

I have used the Java stack to implement the logic and methods to manipulate the data coming from the user on Postman. 
I used PostgreSQL to structure my database on DBeaver, and connected it to my Java application using Javalin.

Project0 showcases all of the different things I've learned over my short time with Revature.
